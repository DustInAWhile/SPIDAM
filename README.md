# SPIDAM
This project aims to create a comprehensive interactive data analysis and modeling platform focused on improving voice intelligibility in large enclosed spaces. In such environments, poor acoustic treatments can result in long reverberation times (RT60), which negatively affect hearing and learning. Our platform enables users to seamlessly import, clean, visualize, analyze, and model acoustic data using scientific calculations and data visualization tools. By addressing the challenges of reverberation time in enclosed spaces, this platform helps users identify and mitigate issues that disrupt voice intelligibility.

## Why It's Made:
This program can reduce issues with voice intelligebility by quantifiying reverberation. Using the created graphs, we can understand why and how our voices are distorted. This will allow for more intellegent design of spaces, depending on how much reverberation you desire. With the simple uplaod of an audio file, you can now measure the reverberation.


## Usage Instructions:
Simply upload a file first, these files should be converted into the proper wav. format for our program. Then, the data will be computed and you simpoly choose what data you wish to view.
